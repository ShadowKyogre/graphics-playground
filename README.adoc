= Graphics Playground

You're probably wondering,
"What the heck IS this!"

They're some tools that I wrote in case
I get the itch to write random graphics code.

live-playground::
	Tools to play with live code samples
	before integrating examples into your javascript or
	cairo project.
	+
	Warning: These are NOT written with security in mind.
	They assume you know what you're doing since they're meant to
	test code snippets.
	+
	There's probably a way to play with OpenGL model code snippets too.
	Just haven't figured it out yet.

examples::
	Label says it all.
	The folder structure is as such:
		* name
			* html5-canvas.js
			* cairo.py
			* qt.py
